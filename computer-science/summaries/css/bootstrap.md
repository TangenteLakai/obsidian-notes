- _Bootstrap_ is one of these frameworks that we can use to beautify our HTML and easily perfect design elements such that our pages are more readable.
- Bootstrap can be utilized by adding the following `link` tag in the `head` of your [html](contents-html.md) file:
```html
<head>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
