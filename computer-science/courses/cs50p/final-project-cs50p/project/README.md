### Important Notes

> This is my **first real coding project**, so if there are any issues, please open an issue!  
> I learned coding in Python via the [CS50 Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) and gained PyQt6 knowledge from [Python GUIs](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6/).  
> Currently, this is a **basic alpha version** of the game.
