## Hexadecimal

- **16** counting values:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
```

- Notice that `F` would represent `15` in decimal
- Hexadecimal is also known as `base-16`
- Examples:

| Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0       | 00          |
| 1       | 01          |
| 9       | 09          |
| 10      | 0A          |
| 15      | 0F          |
| 16      | 10          |
| 255     | FF          |

- The highest you can count with two-digit Hexadecimal is `FF` (Decimal: `255`)
- Hexadecimal is useful because you can represent higher numbers with fewer digits
