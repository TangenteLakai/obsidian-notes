- IDs are very similar to [classes](classes.md) but instead of the dot to access the [HTML](contents-html.md) object you use an hashtag
- Commonly you use classes but if you want to use an object in [JavaScript](contents-javascript.md) IDs are needed for that implementation
- **Example:**

HTML:

```html
<p id=paragraph-script>This paragraph has an ID</p>
```

CSS:

```css
#paragraph-script {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: large;
}
```
