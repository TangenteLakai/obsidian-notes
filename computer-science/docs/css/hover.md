## Explanation

- Common **anchor tag** which runs if the user is **hovering** with the mouse over the element



## Example:

```css
a {
	color: red;
	text-decoration: none
}

a:hover {
	color: blue;
	text-decoration: underline;
}
```

- **Hyperlink** changes color to blue and underlines as the user hovers over it
