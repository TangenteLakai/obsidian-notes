- _Bubble sort_ is another sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping elements to “bubble” larger elements to the end.
- The pseudocode for bubble sort is:
    
    ```
Repeat n-1 times
    For i from 0 to n–2
        If numbers[i] and numbers[i+1] out of order
            Swap them
    If no swaps
        Quit
    ```
