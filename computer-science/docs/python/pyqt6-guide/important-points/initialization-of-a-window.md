# Initialization-of-a-window

```Python
def initializeUI(self):
        self.setGeometry(150, 50, 700, 700)
        self.setWindowTitle('Empty Window in PyQt')
        Self.setWindowIcon(„icon_name.ico“)
        self.show()
```

`setGeometry`:

-  `150`: The x-coordinate of the window's top-left corner, setting how far it is from the left edge of the screen.
- `50`: The y-coordinate of the window's top-left corner, setting how far it is from the top edge of the screen.
- `700`: The width of the window in pixels.
- `700`: The height of the window in pixels.
