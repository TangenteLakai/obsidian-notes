- To create a typable input field use the `input()` function:
```python
input("Name: ")
```

- Assign to [variables](computer-science/docs/python/variables.md) to use in later operations
```python
name = input("Name: ")
```

- Use different [types](computer-science/docs/python/types.md) to specify what can be inputted by the user
```python
age = int(input)
```
