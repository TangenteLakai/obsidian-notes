# Variables

- Defining variables in Python is very compact in design:

```python
age = 18
name = "Lukas"
```

- You can add [type](computer-science/docs/python/types.md) annotations like in [style](computer-science/docs/python/style.md)
- This resolves the major flaw of variables in python 

```python
age: int = 18
name: str = "Lukas"
```
