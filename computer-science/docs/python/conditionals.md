# Conditionals

## Compare Two Values

with multiple conditions

```python
if x > y:
	# do something
elif x < y:
	# do something else
else:
	# previous conditions not met
```

## Chain Conditions

### 1. And

```python
if x > y and x == y:
	# both conditions are met
```

### 2. Or

```python
if x > y or x == y:
	# one or more of the conditions are met
```
