- **_Hashing_** is the idea of taking a value and being able to output a value that becomes a shortcut to it later.

- For example, hashing _apple_ may hash as a value of `1`, and _berry_ may be hashed as `2`. Therefore, finding _apple_ is as easy as asking the _hash_ algorithm where _apple_ is stored. While not ideal in terms of design, ultimately, putting all _a_’s in one bucket and _b_’s in another, this concept of _bucketizing_ hashed values illustrates how you can use this concept: **a hashed value can be used to shortcut finding such a value.**
