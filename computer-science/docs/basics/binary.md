- Computers count in binary
- If you imagine a light bulb: 1 means light bulb one, 2 means light bulb off
- Representing numbers in Binary:

Example:

```c
4 2 1 
1 1 1
```

would equal **seven**

- Generally you use 8 Bits so one Byte

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

- with one byte you can count up to 255 (in binary: 11111111)
