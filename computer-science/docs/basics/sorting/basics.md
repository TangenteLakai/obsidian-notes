# Basics

- Sorting is the process of transforming data (often [arrays](lecture-2-arrays.md)) to a sorted one
- it is very useful because it is easier, for the computer, to search via [binary search](binary-search.md), which can only be performed on sorted data instead of [linear search](linear-search.md)
- There are different kinds of sorting algorithms each with their individual purpose you can [visualize](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) a comparison of these algorithms
