| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| BLOB    | binary large objects that are groups of ones and zeros |
| INTEGER | an integer                                             |
| NUMERIC | for numbers that are formatted specially like dates    |
|         |                                                        |

         
      -- 
      -- 
  REAL       -- like a float
  TEXT       -- for strings and the like
